					h4 The Basics
					p Held weekly, the Series is broken down into smaller components called Tracks: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In these tracks, will be classes/sessions where students will be taught the fundamentals and best practices in each Track. We'll start with the basics in laying out HTML, then learn what it takes to style the HTML using what's called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and interact with the HTML using JavaScript.
