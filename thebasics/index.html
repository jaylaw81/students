                <h1>Second Most Popular Breed Of Dog</h1>
                <p>The German Shepherd is a breed of large-sized working dog that originated in Germany.
The breeds officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog in the English language, sometimes abbreviated as GSD, and was also formerly known as the Alsatian and Alsatian Wolf Dog in Britain.
The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899.
As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including search-and-rescue, police and military roles and even acting.
The German Shepherd is the second-most popular breed of dog in the United States and fourth-most popular in the United Kingdom.
German Shepherds have a variety of colors, the most common of which are tan/black and red/black. Most color varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic saddle to an over-all blanket. Rarer colour variations include the sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver and blue varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification in some standards</p>
