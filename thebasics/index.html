              <h1>Canis Lupus, the gray Wolf.</h1>
              <p>The gray wolf was once one of the world's most widely distributed
              mammals The gray wolf is one of the world's best known and well researched animals,
with probably more books written about it than any other wildlife species
The gray wolf (Canis lupus), also known as the timber wolf, true wolf or western
wolf is a canid native to the wilderness and remote areas of North America, Eurasia,
and North Africa
It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging 43–45 kg
(95–99 lb), and females 36–38.5 kg (79–85 lb).
Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger
size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle.
Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color,
although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur.

<p>The gray wolf is the most specialised member of the genus Canis,
as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey,
its more gregarious nature, and its highly advanced expressive behavior.
It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species, such as
the eastern wolf, coyote and golden jackal to produce fertile hybrids.
It is the only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the
Old and New Worlds, and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene,
colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the
Rancholabrean.</p>

<p>Wolves are social animals, travelling in nuclear families consisting
of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring. <a href="" title="">The
gray wolf is typically an apex predator </a> throughout its range, with only humans and tigers
posing a serious threat to it. It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though
it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.</p>
