                 <h2>Dogs</h2>
                 <p>Dogs are mammals, which were domesticated from wolves. The scientific name of dog is <i>Canis lupus familiaris</i>, which is similar to the wolf scientific name. Dogs are often referred to fondly as Man's Best Friend. Also, labradors (pictured above) are the number one dog in the world. Dogs are playful, cute pets, and everyone should have an opportunity to have one. Even if the care of a dog worries you, the cons of having a dog are wayyy less than the pros- or the awesomeness- of having a dog! </p>
                 <h1>History of Labs</h1>
                 <p>The gentle, intelligent and family-friendly Labrador Retriever from Canada continues to be the most popular breed in the United States
A favourite assistance dog breed in these and other countries, Labradors are frequently trained to aid people who are blind and people with autism, act as therapy dogs, and perform screening and detection work for law enforcement and other official agencies.
They are prized as sporting and waterfowl hunting dogs.
A few kennels breeding dogs were in England at the same time a combination of sheep protection policy (Newfoundland) and rabies quarantine (England) led to their gradual demise in their country of originThe Labrador Retriever, also known as simply Labrador or Lab, is one of several kinds of retrievers, a type of gun dog. Labradors are athletic, playful, and the most popular breed of dog by registered ownership in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States (since 1991).</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>There are two types of Labradors, the English Labrador and the American Labrador. The English bred Lab comes from English bred stock. Its general appearance is different than the American bred Lab. The English bred Labs are heavier, thicker and blockier. The American bred Lab comes from American bred stock and is tall and lanky. The double coat is smooth and does not have any waves. Coat colors come in solid black, yellow or chocolate. There is also said to be a rare silver or gray color that is referred to by the AKC as a shade of chocolate. This color is controversial and some claim it is a Weimaraner cross, while others say it is a true mutation. The head of the Labrador is broad with a moderate stop. The nose is thick, black on black and yellow dogs and brown on chocolate dogs. The nose color often fades and is not considered a fault in the show ring. The teeth should meet in a scissors or level bite. The muzzle is fairly wide. The neck is proportionately wide and powerful. The body is slightly longer than tall. The short, hard coat is easy to care for and water-resistant. The medium-sized eyes are set well apart. Eye color should be brown in yellow and black dogs and hazel or brown in chocolate dogs. Some Labs can also have green or greenish-yellow eyes. In silver dogs the eye color is usually gray. The eye rims are black in yellow and black dogs and brown in chocolate dogs. The ears are medium in size, hanging down and pendant in shape. The otter tail is thick at the base, gradually tapering towards the tip. It is completely covered with short hair, with no feathering. The feet are strong and compact with webbed feet which aid the dog in swimming.</p>
    <h2>Behavior</h2>
