                <p>Chupacabra is Spanish for “goat sucker”.
Chupacabras have been described as resembling a rodent or reptile, with green-gray skin and a disgusting odor.
Most experts believe the Chupacabra to be a coyote with mange, which is a skin disease that can cause their hair to fall out and the skin to shrivel.
The chupacabra or chupacabras is a legendary cryptid rumored to inhabit parts of the Americas, with the first sightings reported in Puerto Rico. The name comes from the animal's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, especially goats.
Numerous sightings of the creature were reported during the mid-1990s in Mexico, the U.S. Southwest and China. The first reported sightings were in Puerto Rico, US, where more than 200 original reports were made in 1995.
Chupacabra is Spanish for “goat sucker”. The creature’s name derives from stories in Latin America of several dead goats with puncture wounds in their necks and all the blood drained from their bodies.
