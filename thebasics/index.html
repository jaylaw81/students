                <h1>Lions are cool</h1>
                <p>Lions are the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides.
The lion population in Africa has been reduced by almost half since the early 1950s. Today, fewer than 21,000 remain in all of Africa.
Prides are family units that may include up to three males, a dozen or so females, and their young. All of a pride's lionesses are related, and female cubs typically stay with the group as they age. 
Young males eventually leave and establish their own prides by taking over a group headed by another male. Female lions are the pride's primary hunters. They often work together to prey upon antelopes, zebras, wildebeest, and other large animals of the open grasslands. Many of these animals are faster than lions, so teamwork pays off.</p>
