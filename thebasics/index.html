                <h1>Puppies make the best Christmas Presents</h1>
                <p>Accoring to Huffingtonpost.com, Buzzfeed.com, and thechive.com puppies make the 
                    best presents.  
                </p>
                <h2>All 5 kids would love it</h2>
                <p> Imagine the tears of Joy that would come over their faces as they unwrap the dog... better yet imagin the tears and reaction 
                    video that you could record if I opened a box with a puppy in it.  
                </p>
                 <h3>English Bulldogs make the best videos on imgur and Youtube</h3>

                <p>English Bulldogs have greaet personalities.  They make adorable sounds and snore.  They make super cute videos that Ethan and Keziah would have so much fun filming...
                Because they are calm and dont have very much energy they do not require us to take
                them for walks everyday.  More of a couch potato dog. </p>
