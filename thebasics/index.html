                <h1>For My Husband</h1>
                <p>  Dont be distracted by all these cute wrinkly puppies.  I am so glad that I took this class 
                and can make this website for you. 
                </p>
                <h2>I love YOU</h2>
                <p> Well babe, I cant even begin to tell you how much I love you.   You are my best friend, my rock, and so much more then words can express.  
                You push me to be a better me.  You love me unconditionly so much that I dont even see it sometimes. 
                You are my biggest fan and support me in all my ventures.  I love your laugh when we watch funny shows that make you laugh so hard you cry...
                You make me feel beautiful even when I feel baggy and gross. 
                When I feel down you cheer me up.
                You go out of your way for others even when they dont desrve it
                YOu are a leader and great expample for me to follow.  You are an awesome writer and write me poems. 
                You are an amazing "ghetto master chef".
                You aspire to always be better.
                You are super sexy.
                When I am not strong you are strong for me...you build me up when I am down.
                You watch shows with me even when you dont want to becuase you know I like it.
                Your always true to yourself.
                Your always teaching me something new.
                You always work very hard to support  our family. 
                You Love to learn.  I love the way I fit perfectly in your arms.  Your hug and embrace.  The way you grab me in the middle of the night makes me feel safe and loved. 
                You are a computer genius.  You help me even when you dont want to.  You make things fun when they are nomally boring. Your rendition of Monty Python stuff makes it funny. 
                You do great impersonations that make me smile and laugh.  You love my feet.  You talk things out even when its hard or you dont want to.  You put up with all my hippie ways even if you dont embrace them (yet).
                You encourage me to be me.   
                </p>
                
                <p>I truly believe that together we can do anything.  We have overcome so many things together.  I am so glad that you
                are at my side and that we get to experience this life together.  </p>
                
                <p>There are so many exciting things right around the corner and I am so excited to share them with you
                and conquer them with you.  </p>
                
                
                 <h3>English Bulldogs make some of best videos on imgur and Youtube</h3>
                 <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/stgwckDQZUo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>English Bulldogs have great personalities.  They make adorable sounds and snore.  They make super cute videos that Ethan and Keziah would have so much fun filming.
                </p>
                <p>Because they are <a href="calm" title="#"></a> and dont have very much energy they do not require us to take
                them for walks everyday.  More of a couch potato dog. </p>
